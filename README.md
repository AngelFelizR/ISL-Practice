# An Introduction to Statistical Learning

## SL goal

It is to estimate the next:

![unknow function](img/01-unknow-function.PNG)

- **f unknown function** of X1,...,Xp
- **Random error (ϵ)**: independent of X and has mean zero. It also correspond to the **irreducible error** as it cannot be predicted using X.

An error is **reducible** if we can improve the accuracy of ˆf by using the most appropriate statistical learning technique to estimate f.
