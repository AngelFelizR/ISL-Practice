# Basic concepts

## Reducible and irreducible error

The goal when we are analyzing data is to find a function that based on some Predictors and some random noise could explain the Response variable.

$$
Y = f(X) + \epsilon
$$

**$\epsilon$** represent the **random error** and correspond to the **irreducible error** as it cannot be predicted using the Predictors in regression models. It would have a mean of 0 unless are missing some relevant Predictors. 

In classification models, the **irreducible error** is represented by the **Bayes Error Rate**.

$$
1 -  E\left( 
     \underset{j}{max}Pr(Y = j|X)
     \right)
$$

An error is **reducible** if we can improve the accuracy of $\hat{f}$ by using a most appropriate statistical learning technique to estimate $f$.

The challenge to achieve that goal it's that we don't at the beginning how much of the error correspond to each type.

$$
\begin{split}
E(Y-\hat{Y})^2 & = E[f(X) + \epsilon - \hat{f}(X)]^2 \\
               & = \underbrace{[f(X)- \hat{f}(x)]^2}_\text{Reducible} +
                   \underbrace{Var(\epsilon)}_\text{Irredicible}
\end{split}
$$

The reducible error can be also spitted in two parts:

- **Variance** refers to the amount by which $\hat{f}$ would change if we estimate it using a different **training data set**. If a method has high variance then small changes in the training data can result in large changes of $\hat{f}$.

- **Squared bias** refers to the error that is introduced by approximating a real-life problem, which may be extremely complicated, by a much simpler model as for example a linear model.


$$
E(y_{0} - \hat{f}(x_{0}))^2 = 
Var(\hat{f}(x_{0})) + 
[Bias(\hat{f}(x_{0}))]^2 + 
Var(\epsilon)
$$

::: {.callout-note}

Our challenge lies in ﬁnding a method for which both the variance and the squared bias are low.

## Types of models

- **Parametric methods**
    1. Make an assumption about the functional form. For example, assuming linearity.
    2. Estimate a small number parameters based on training data.
    3. Are easy to interpret.
    4. Tend to outperform non-parametric approaches when there is a small number of observations per predictor.

    
- **Non-parametric methods**
    1.  Don't make an assumption about the functional form, to accurately ﬁt a wider range of possible shapes for $f$.
    2.  Need a large number of observations in order to obtain an accurate estimate for $f$.
    3.  The data analyst must select a level of smoothness (degrees of freedom).

## Evaluating model performance

To evaluate how good works a models we need to split the available data in two parts. 

- **Training data**: Used to fit the model.
- **Test data**: Used to confirm how well the model works with new data.

Some measurements to evaluate our test data are:

- **Test mean squared error (MSE)**

$$
Ave(y_{0}-\hat{f}(x_{0}))^2
$$

- **Test error rate**

$$
I(y_{0} \neq \hat{y}_{0}) = 
\begin{cases}
    1 & \text{If } y_{0} \neq \hat{y}_{0} \\
    0 & \text{If } y_{0} = \hat{y}_{0}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
Ave(I(y_{0} \neq \hat{y}_{0}))
$$ 

# Linear regresion

## Getting the Least Squares Line of a sample

As the *population regression line* is unobserved the *least squares line* of a sample is a good estimation. To get it we need to follow the next steps:

1. Define the function to fit.

$$
\hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_{0} + \hat{\beta}_{1} x
$$

2. Define how to calculate **residuals**.

$$
e_{i} = y_{i} - \hat{y}_{i}
$$

3. Define the **residual sum of squares (RSS)**.

$$
RSS = e_{1}^2 + e_{2}^2 + \dots + e_{n}^2
$$

4. Use calculus or make estimation with a computer to find the coefficients that minimize the RSS.

$$
\hat{\beta}_{1} = \frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-\overline{x})(y_{i}-\overline{y})}
                       {\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-\overline{x})}
, \quad
\hat{\beta}_{0} = \overline{y} - \hat{\beta}_{1}\overline{x}
$$

## Getting confident intervarls of coeffients

To estimate the **population regression line** we can calculate **conﬁdence intervals** for sample coefficients, to define a range where we can find the population values with a defined **confidence level**.

> If we want to use 95% of confidence we need to know that after taking many samples only 95% of the intervals produced with this **confident level** would have the true value (parameter).

To generate confident intervals we would need to calculate the variance of the *random error*. 

$$
\sigma^2 = Var(\epsilon)
$$

But as we can not calculate that variance an alternative can be to estimate it based on residuals if they meet the next conditions:

1. Each residual have common variance $\sigma^2$, so the variances of the error terms shouldn't have any relation with the value of the response.
2. Residuals are uncorrelated. For example, if $\epsilon_{i}$ is positive, that provides little or no information about the sign of $\epsilon_{i+1}$. 

If not, we would end underestimating the true standard errors, reducing the probability a given confident level to contain the true value of the parameter and underrating the *p-values* associated with the model.

$$
\sigma \approx RSE = \sqrt{\frac{RSS}{(n-p-1)}}
$$

Now we can calculate the **standard error** of each coefficient and calculate the confident intervals.

$$
SE(\hat{\beta_{0}})^2 = \sigma^2 
                       \left[\frac{1}{n}+
                             \frac{\overline{x}^2}
                                  {\Sigma_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i}-\overline{x})^2} 
                       \right]
$$

$$
SE(\hat{\beta_{1}})^2 = \frac{\sigma^2}
                             {\Sigma_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} - \overline{x})^2}
$$


$$  
\hat{\beta_{1}} \pm 2 \cdot SE(\hat{\beta_{1}}), \quad \hat{\beta_{0}} \pm 2 \cdot SE(\hat{\beta_{0}})
$$

## Insights to extract

### Confirm the relationship between the Response and Predictors

Use the regression **overall P-value** (based on the F-statistic) to confirm that at **least one predictor** is related with the Response and avoid interpretative problems associated with the number of observations (_n_) or predictors (_p_).
  
  
$$
H_{0}: \beta_{1} = \beta_{2} = \dots = \beta_{p} = 0
$$

$$
H_{a}: \text{at least one } \beta_{j} \text{ is non-zero}
$$


### Accuracy of the model (relationship strength)

If we want to know how well the model fits to the data we have two options:

- **Residual standard error (RSE)**: Even if the model were correct, the actual values of $\hat{y}$ would differ from the true regression line by approximately *this units*, on average. To get the percentage error we can calculate $RSE/\overline{x}$

- **The $R^2$ statistic**: The proportion of variance explained by taking as a reference the **total sum of squares (TSS)**.

$$
TSS = \Sigma(y_{i} - \overline{y})^2
$$

$$
R^2 = \frac{TSS - RSS}{TSS}
$$


$$
R^2 = 
\begin{cases}
    Cor(X, Y)^2  & \text{Simple Lineal Regresion} \\
    Cor(Y,\hat{Y})^2 & \text{Multipline Lineal Regresion}
\end{cases}
$$


### Confirm the relationship between the Response and each predictor

To answer that we can test if a particular subset of q of the coefficients are zero. 
  
$$
H_{0}: \beta_{p-q+1} = \beta_{p-q+2} = \dots = \beta_{p} = 0
$$

In this case, F-statistic reports the **partial eﬀect** of adding a extra variable to the model (the order matters) to apply a *variable selection* technique. The classical approach is to:

1. Fit a model for each variable combination $2^p$.
2. Select the best model based on *Mallow’s Cp*, *Akaike information criterion (AIC)*, *Bayesian information criterion (BIC)*, and *adjusted* $R^2$ or plot various model outputs, such as the residuals, in order to search for patterns.

But just think that if we have $p = 30$ we will have $2^{30} = =1,073,741,824\ models$ to fit, that it's too much. Some alternative approaches for this task:

- Forward selection
- Backward selection (cannot be used if p >n)
- Mixed selection

### Size of association between each predictor and the response.

To check that we need to see the $\hat{\beta}_{j}$ confident intervals as the real $\beta_{j}$ is in that range.

### Predicting future values

If we want to predict the average response $f(X)$ we can use the confident intervals, but if we want to predict an individual response $Y = f(X) + \epsilon$ we need to use prediction intervals as they account for the uncertainty associated with $\epsilon$, the irreducible error.


## Standard linear regression model assumptions
  
- The **additivity assumption** means that the association between a predictor $X_{j}$ and the response $Y$ does not depend on the values of the other predictors, as it happens when there is a *interaction (synergy) effect*

- The **linearity assumption** states that the change in the response Y associated with a one-unit change in $X_{j}$ is constant, regardless of the value of $X_{j}$.

### Including an interaction term

This approach relax the *additivity assumption* that models usually have. 

- **2 quantitative variables**

It consist in adding an extra coefficient which multiplies two or more variables.

$$
\begin{split}
Y & = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X_{1} + \beta_{2} X_{2} + \beta_{3} X_{1} X_{2} + \epsilon \\
  & = \beta_{0} + (\beta_{1} + \beta_{3} X_{2}) X_{1} + \beta_{2} X_{2} + \epsilon \\
  & = \beta_{0} + \tilde{\beta}_{1} X_{1} + \beta_{2} X_{2} + \epsilon
\end{split}
$$

After adding the interaction term we could interpret the change as making one of the original coefficient a function of the another variable. Now we could say that *$\beta_{3}$ represent __the change of $X_{1}$ effectiveness__ associated with a one-unit increase in $X_{2}$*.

It very important that we keep **hierarchical principle**, which states that if we include an interaction in a model, we should also include the main effects, even if the p-values associated with their coefficients are not significant as ***it would alter the meaning of the interaction***.

- **1 quantitative and 1 qualitative variable**

If $X_{1}$ is quantitative and $X_{2}$ is qualitative:

$$
\hat{Y} = 
\begin{cases}
    (\beta_{0} + \beta_{2}) + (\beta_{1} + \beta_{3})X_{1} & \text{if }X_{2} \text{ is TRUE}\\
    \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X_{1}                             & \text{if }X_{2} \text{ is FALSE}
\end{cases}
$$

Adding the $\beta_{3}$ interaction allow the line to change the line slope based on $X_{2}$ and not just a different intercept.

### Polynomial regression

This approach relax the *linearity assumption* that models usually have. It consist in including transformed versions of the predictors.

$$
\begin{split}
Y & = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X_{1} + \beta_{2} X_{2} \\
  & = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X_{1} + \beta_{2} X_{1}^2 
\end{split}
$$


## Possible problems

### Non-linearity of the response-predictor relationships

|Detection method|Solutions|
|:---------------|:--------|
|Plot the **residuals versus predicted values** $\hat{y}_{i}$. Ideally, the residual plot will show no discernible pattern. The presence of a pattern may indicate a problem with some aspect of the linear model.|A simple approach is to use non-linear transformations of the predictors, such as $\log{X}$, $\sqrt{X}$, and $X^2$, in the regression model|

![](img/04-residuals-predicted-values.png){fig-align="center"}

### Correlation of error terms

|Detection method|Solutions|
|:---------------|:--------|
|1. Plot the residuals from our model as a function of time or execution order. If the errors are uncorrelated, then there should be no discernible pattern. </br> </br> 2. Check if some observation have been exposed to the same environmental factors|Good experimental design is crucial in order to mitigate these problems|

### Non-constant variance (heteroscedasticity) of error terms

|Detection method|Solutions|
|:---------------|:--------|
|Plot the residual plot en check if you can see a funnel shape|We can transform the response using a concave function such as $\log{Y}$ or $\sqrt{Y}$|

![](img/05-non-constance-variance.png){fig-align="center"}

### Outliers

An outlier is a point for which $y_{i}$ is far from the value predicted by the model. Sometimes, they have little effect on the least squares line, but *over estimate the RSE* making bigger p-values of the model and *under estimate the $R^2$*.

|Detection method|Solutions|
|:---------------|:--------|
|Plot the **studentized residuals**, computed by dividing each residual $e_{i}$ by its estimated standard error. Then search for points which absolute value is greater than 3|They can be removed if it has occurred due to an error in data collection. Otherwise, they may indicate a deficiency with the model, such as a missing predictor.|

![](img/06-studentized-residuals-plot.png){fig-align="center"}

### High-leverage points

Observations with **high leverage** have an unusual value for $x_{i}$. High leverage observations tend to have a sizable impact on the estimated regression line and any problems with these points may invalidate the entire fit.

|Detection method|Solutions|
|:---------------|:--------|
|Compute the leverage statistic. Find an observation with higher value than mean, represented by $(p + 1)/n$. Leverage values are always between $1/n$ and $1$|Make sure that the value is correct and not a data collection problem|

$$
h_{i} = \frac{1}{n} + 
        \frac{(x_{i} - \overline{x})^2}
              {\Sigma_{i'=1}^n(x_{i'} - \overline{x})^2}
$$

In a *multiple linear regression*, it is possible to have an observation that is well within the range of each individual predictor’s values, but that is unusual in terms of the full set of predictors.

![](img/07-studentized-residuals-leverage-plot.png){fig-align="center"}

### Collinearity

**Collinearity** refers to the situation in which two or more predictor variables are closely related (highly correlated) to one another. It reduces the accuracy of the estimates of the regression coeﬃcients and causes the standard error for $\hat{\beta}_{j}$ to grow. That reduce the **power of the hypothesis test**,that is, the probability of correctly detecting a non-zero coeﬃcient.

Looking at the correlation matrix of the predictors could be usefull, but it is possible for collinearity to exist between three or more variables even if no pair of variables has a particularly high correlation (**multicollinearity**). 

|Detection method|Solutions|
|:---------------|:--------|
|The best way to assess multicollinearity is to compute the **variance inﬂation factor (VIF)**, which is the ratio of the variance of $\hat{\beta}_{j}$ when ﬁtting the full model divided by the variance of $\hat{\beta}_{j}$ if ﬁt on its own with 1 as its lowest value and 5 or 10 as problematic values of collinearity|1. Drop one of the problematic variables from the regression. </br> </br> 2. Combine the collinear variables together into a single predictor|


$$
\text{VIF}(\hat{\beta}_{j}) = \frac{1}
                                   {1 - R_{X_{j}|X_{-j}}^2}
$$

Where $R_{X_{j}|X_{-j}}^2$ is the $R^2$ from a regression of $X_{j}$ onto all of the other predictors.

# K-nearest neighbors (KNN) 

This method performs worst than a parametric as we starting adding *noise* predictors. In fact, we will get in the situation where for a given observation has no *nearby neighbors*, known as **curse of dimensionality** and leading to a
very poor prediction of $f(x_{0})$.

## Classiﬁer

The next function estimates the conditional probability for class $j$ as the fraction of points in $N_{0}$ whose response values equal $j$.

$$
\text{Pr}(Y = j|X = x_{0}) = \frac{1}{K} 
                      \displaystyle\sum_{i \in N_{0}} I(y_{i} = j)
$$

- Where
  - $j$ response value to test
  - $x_{0}$ is the test observation
  - $K$ the number of points in the training data that are closest to $x_{0}$ and reduce the model flexibility
  - $N_{0}$ points in the training data that are closest to $x_{0}$
  
Then KNN classiﬁes the test observation $x_{0}$ to the class with the largest probability.

![](img/08-knn-classifier.png){fig-align="center"}

## Regression

KNN regression estimates f(x0) using the average of all the training responses in $N_{0}$.
 
$$
\hat{f}(x_{0}) = \frac{1}{K} 
                      \displaystyle\sum_{i \in N_{0}} y_{i}
$$

- Where
  - $x_{0}$ is the test observation
  - $K$ the number of points in the training data that are closest to $x_{0}$ and reduce the model flexibility
  - $N_{0}$ points in the training data that are closest to $x_{0}$
